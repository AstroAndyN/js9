<h3>JS9 Multi-Extension FITS Files</h3>

<p>
The <b>Extensions</b> plugin allows you to display the HDU extensions
in a multi-extension FITS file. Simply click on the desired extension
to display it. The raw data of the new extension replaces the previous
raw data, allowing browser-based analysis to be run on the new extension.

<p>
Note that some extensions are not available for display, including images
of less than two dimensions, and binary tables not containing x and y columns.
These extensions are marked as invalid by a strike through their description.

<p>
See <a href=" http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_primer.html" target="_blank">the FITS Primer</a>
for information about HDUs and multi-extension FITS.
