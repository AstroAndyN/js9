<h3>FITS Image Sections, with Binning and Filtering</h3>

The rows in a FITS binary table must be binned before being displayed
as an image.  By default, JS9 uses a bin factor of 1 to extract the
central 2048 x 2048 section of the data for display. This default is
controlled by the JS9.globalOpts.table object properties, which can be
set in your js9Prefs.js file.

<p>
Also by default, the central 2048 x 2048 section of a FITS image is displayed
at bin 1. This default is controlled by the JS9.globalOpts.image object
properties, which can be set in your js9Prefs.js file.

<p>
The Binning plugin allows you to extract sections from FITS binary
tables and images, allowing you to choose the image center, image
dimensions, and bin factor.  For tables, the plugin also allows you to
filter rows of the table by means of arithmetic and boolean operations
on the table columns.

<p>
When extracting an image section, you can set one or more of the
following options:
<ul>
<li> <b>center:</b> the file (physical) coordinates around which to
perform the section extraction.
<li> <b>dims:</b> the size of the image to extract (before binning is
performed).
<li> <b>bin:</b> determines how many physical pixels are summed into
an image pixel.
</ul>
<p>
For example, if a table has FITS (tlmin, tlmax) dimensions 4096 x 4096, then:
<ul>
<li> <b>bin: 4, dimensions: 4096 x 4096</b> will bin the entire file by 4 to
produce a 1024 x 1024 image.
<li> <b>bin: 2, dimensions: 1024 x 1024</b> will bin the central 1024 x 1024
section of the image by 2 to produce a 512 x 512 image.
<li> <b>bin: 2, dimensions: 1024 x 1024, center: 1024, 1024</b> will bin the upper left
2048 x 2048 section of the image by 2 to produce a 512 x 512 image.
</ul> 

<p>
Table filtering allows you  to select rows from an FITS binary table
(e.g., an X-ray event list) by checking each row against an expression
involving the columns in the table. When a table is filtered, only
valid rows satisfying these expressions are used to make the image.

<p>
A filter expression consists of an arithmetic or logical operation
involving one or more column values from a table. Columns can be
compared to other columns or to numeric constants. Standard JavaScript
math functions can be applied to columns. JavaScript (or C) semantics
are used when constructing expressions, with the usual precedence and
associativity rules holding sway:
<pre>
  Operator                                Associativity
  --------                                -------------
  ()                                      left to right
  !  (bitwise not) - (unary minus)        right to left
  *  /                                    left to right
  +  -                                    left to right
  &lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;=                               left to right
  == !=                                   left to right
  &  (bitwise and)                        left to right
  ^  (bitwise exclusive or)               left to right
  |  (bitwise inclusive or)               left to right
  && (logical and)                        left to right
  || (logical or)                         left to right
  =                                       right to left
</pre>
For example, if energy and pha are columns in a table, 
then the following are valid expressions:
<pre>
  pha > 1
  energy == pha
  pha > 1 && energy <= 2
  max(pha,energy)>=2.5
</pre>

<p>
NB: when using cfitsio (the default, instead of fitsy.js), table
filtering follows cfitsio conventions, which is documented
<a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/c/c_user/node97.html">here</a>.

<p>
NB: the range list support described below works only when using
fitsy.js. It does not work for cfitsio.

<p>
In addition to the standard JavaScript/C syntax, fitsy.js filter expressions
can make use of IRAF-style <b>range lists</b> which specify a range of
values. The syntax requires that the column name be followed by an '='
sign, which is followed by a range expression of the form:
<pre>
  col = :v            # col <= v in range
  col = v:            # col >= v in range
  col = v1:v2         # v1 <= col <= v2 in range
</pre>
The v values above must be numeric constants. 
<p>
[A note for DS9/funtools users: the DS9/funtools syntax supported a
comma operator, which I now consider to be one of the bigger design
mistakes of my career. The problem is that the operator either meant
logical AND or logical OR, depending on context. This led to a lot of
confusion. For JS9, the comma operator has been removed, so that you
now explicitly and clearly specify the logical operator:
<pre>
  pi=1:4 || pi=7:9    # equivalent to DS9's pi=1:4,7:9
  pi > 5 || pha > 6   # equivalent to DS9's pi > 5, pha > 6
  pi > 5 && pha > 6   # this had no comma equivalent and caused confusion!
</pre>
Hmmm ... I might have mixed up the last two examples. QED]

<p>
Once the desired parameters have been set, pressing the <b>Rebin</b>
button will filter, bin and display the data.
