JS9 is our Web-based implementation of DS9, the de facto standard image display
for astronomy. With JS9, you can:

  - display URL-based FITS images and binary tables
  - drag and drop FITS images and binary tables
  - change the colormap and scale
  - manipulate the contrast/bias with the mouse
  - display pixel values and WCS position information
  - create and manipulate geometric regions of interest
  - add your own extensions using plugins and the public api
  - perform local (browser-based) data analysis via plugins
  - perform remote (server-side) data analysis via node.js or CGI
  - display RGB composite images
  - control JS9 from the command line
  - print images

The JS9 Website contains on-line documentation, demos, and downloads:

    http://js9.si.edu

JS9 can change how we think about image display and analysis, moving
beyond the Desktop into the Web. You can simply drag and drop a FITS
image from your computer onto this JS9 display. All of basic JS9/DS9
functionality is immediately available: zoom, pan, colormaps, scaling,
regions, WCS, etc.

You can extend JS9 using the plugin facility in combination with the
JS9 public API. For example, you can perform browser-based analysis on
the displayed image. On the JS9 Website, click the Plugins tab, create
a region, and move it around ...

In addition, data files loaded from the server support server-side
analysis (using the original data files on the back-end server).
Server-side analysis can be run, for example, in response to region
changes, with the results displayed back in your browser. On the JS9
Website, click the Analysis tab, choose a task, create a region, and
move it around ...
