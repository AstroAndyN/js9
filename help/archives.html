<h3><center>How to Access Data Archives with JS9</center></h3>
<ul>
<li> visit a data archive Web page in your browser
<li> execute a search for the desired observation
<li> copy the resulting FITS file link
<li> in JS9, select the <b>File:open link via proxy ...</b> menu option
<li> paste the FITS URL link into the dialog box
<li> click the <b>Load</b> button
</ul>

<h3><center>Details: Using a Proxy Server to Access FITS Data</center></h3>
<p>
For security reasons, JavaScript contained in one Web page can
access data in another Web page only if both Web pages have the
same origin (i.e., basically coming from the same host).  This
policy is called the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">
Same Origin Policy</a>. This means that JS9 cannot load a FITS file from
an arbitrary URL without using special techniques.
<p>
One such technique is to use a proxy server: the URL is not loaded
directly into JS9, but instead is copied back to the server from which
JS9 itself was loaded. The file is then retrieved by JS9 so that the
"same origin" rules are not violated.
<p>
When the back-end server associated with a JS9 Web page supports the
proxy service, you will see a menu option in the <b>File</b> menu
called <b>open link via proxy ...</b>
<p>
Enter a FITS URL into the proxy dialog box and press the <b>Load</b>
button. The data file will be retrieved by the server and stored in a
directory specifically tied to the Web page. (The directory and its
contents will be deleted when the page is unloaded.)  JS9 then will
load the file from this directory. Note that since the file resides on
the back-end server, all back-end analysis defined on that server is
available.
<p>
This technique can be used with data archives as well as FITS links from
other sources. For example, if you have a FITS file on Google Drive, you
can generate a link and paste it into the proxy dialog box for display.
